# Twiliotest 

My DevOps project journey!!<br>
With the initial ideas of Github pages to creating CVs to lifestyle blogs to Docker Containers to so on and so forth..<br>
I have finally landed myself on Twilio cos it's so fun to explore!<br>I would have hope to stumble upon this way earlier so I can have more time to experiment it!<br> 
And here we go to some contributing guides to Twilio!!<br>

<h1 align="center">Setting Up Whatsapp Push NotificationüöÄ</h1>
A github action which sends a Whatsapp notification when a change is pushed to a repository.

### Getting Started!
1. Create an account in twilio [here](https://www.twilio.com/).  
2. From your twilio dashboard fetch Account Sid and Auth Token.  
3. To encrypt them, create new secrets in your repository named ```account_sid, auth_token, to_whatsapp_no``` and give it's value.  
4. Create a ```.github/workflows/Whatsapps.yml```.  
5. Add the following properties to ```Whatsapps.yml``` file   

```name: When one of the following events occur in the master branch, a message is sent to the Whatsapp.
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: whatsapp-notify
   
        env:
          account_sid: ${{ secrets.ACCOUNT_SID }}
          auth_token: ${{ secrets.AUTH_TOKEN }}
          to_whatsapp_no: ${{ secrets.TO_WHATSAPP_NO }}
        uses: Cindywoo11/Twiliotest@main
      - name : Run
        run: echo 'Start!'
```
